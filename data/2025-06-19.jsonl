Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a\nfew hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient\nmechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively\nevaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically\ntarget scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA\nbenchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and\nnavigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past\ninteractions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents\ninvolves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions\nbased on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together\nrather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for\nlong-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates\nmemory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and\ncontextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally\nextended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation\nof memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate\nstate-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their\nperformance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for\nimprovement."}

Recently,\nsingle-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor\nmeasuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical\ndiagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures\nassociated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections\ncaused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,\nthe limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,\nrequiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.\nIn high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a\nconstrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture\ndetails in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain\nis required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog\nsignal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors\ncollectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic\nimages. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image\nsensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:\nfixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.\nBuilding on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that\nsynergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced\nlearning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine\ndetail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA\nplatforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test\ndataset."}
